## üöÄ About Me

Former Head of Product Offline at Le Wagon, the first Ruby on Rails bootcamp in Europe, and an MVP enthusiast.
I founded two RoR dev shops and slogged through 50+ RoR projects‚Äîrepeatedly adding the same gems, setting up Stripe, and crafting yet another landing page. It was a time-consuming headache...

But I did learn how to launch MVPs to production at lightning speed and in the most cost-effective way possible. Now, I can launch a new product in just a week.
